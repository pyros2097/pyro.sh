                    I like to work on open source and hobby projects.
                    Over the course of 8 years I've accumlated a lot of useful projects used by many people around the
                    world.

                                A rust macro which loads files into the rust binary at compile time during release and
                                loads the file from the fs during dev.

                                Generates go code to embed resource files into your library or executable. This is more
                                suitable for web servers as it gzip compresses all the files automatically and computes
                                the hash so that it can be used for caching the assets in the frontends.

                                A framework in golang to build isomorphic web apps. It uses a declarative syntax using
                                funcs that allows creating and dealing with HTML elements only by using Go, and without
                                writing any HTML markup. The syntax is inspired by react and its hooks and functional
                                component features.

                                A programming language with a syntax largely inspired by nim but with the simplicity of
                                go. It has jsx support in built by default and targets webassembly.
